                        <p><strong>A</strong>lice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
                            in it, `and what is the use of a book,&#8217; thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?&#8217;</p>
                        <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                            when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

                        <p>&#8216;<strong>C</strong>uriouser and curiouser!&#8217; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I&#8217;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
                            Good-bye, feet!&#8217; (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
                            I&#8217;m sure _I_ shan&#8217;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; &#8211;but I must be kind to them,&#8217; thought Alice, `or perhaps they won&#8217;t
                            walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I&#8217;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&#8217; And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. `They must go by the carrier,&#8217; she thought; `and how
                            funny it&#8217;ll seem, sending presents to one&#8217;s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p>

                        <p><strong>T</strong>hey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank&#8211;the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>
                        <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her
                            life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better&#8217;; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and,
                            as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.</p>

                        <p><strong>I</strong>t was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur
                            and whiskers! She&#8217;ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?&#8217; Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she
                            very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen&#8211;everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished
                            completely.
                        </p>
                        <p>Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!&#8217;
                            And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p>
